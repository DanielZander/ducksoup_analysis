 Hi, so I'm the proposer and I proposed four coins, is that ok?

1
0:00:19.790000-->0:00:26.250000
 Seeing here, I wish I knew, I wouldn't have accepted all the lesser coins, so I'm trying

2
0:00:26.250000-->0:00:28.270000
 to meet up with what I have now.

3
0:00:35-->0:00:36.600000
 Ok, that's fine.

4
0:00:38.800000-->0:00:39.140000
 Ok.
