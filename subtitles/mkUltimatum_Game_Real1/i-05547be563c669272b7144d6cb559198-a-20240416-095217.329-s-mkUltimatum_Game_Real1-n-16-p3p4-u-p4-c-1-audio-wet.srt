 Hello.

0:00:01.800000-->0:00:01.940000
 Hello.

2
0:00:04.800000-->0:00:06.720000
 Can you hear me?

3
0:00:09.200000-->0:00:09.740000
 Oh, great.

4
0:00:10.720000-->0:00:11
 All right.

5
0:00:11-->0:00:13.100000
 So, what do you say about three coins?

6
0:00:13.100000-->0:00:14.320000
 That's generous, right?

7
0:00:23.350000-->0:00:23.750000
 All right.

8
0:00:23.750000-->0:00:26.930000
 What's your lowest amount that you're willing to accept?

0:00:36.670000-->0:00:37.570000
 Oh, great.

10
0:00:37.570000-->0:00:37.850000
 Okay.

11
0:00:37.850000-->0:00:38.470000
 I'll give you four.

12
0:00:38.650000-->0:00:40.240000
 Good man.

13
0:00:40.520000-->0:00:40.760000
 Yeah.
