0:00:01.440000-->0:00:08.800000
 Go ahead. Make an offer.

1
0:00:10.350000-->0:00:12.910000
 I'll reject ten. No, I'll reject anything less than ten.

2
0:00:13.550000-->0:00:14.630000
 Ten is fair.

3
0:00:14.750000-->0:00:17.890000
 How do you feel if I said I'll reject anything less than fifteen,

4
0:00:17.890000-->0:00:20.550000
 which is basically what you just did, by offering five.

5
0:00:21.100000-->0:00:23.960000
 So, at least ten. Ten is fair, OK?
