 Hello, what's your offer then, what are you thinking?

1
0:00:08.960000-->0:00:09.640000
 Three coins?

2
0:00:09.680000-->0:00:09.920000
 Ooh.

3
0:00:10.680000-->0:00:15.080000
 Would you be possibly interested in bumping it up to five coins to make it 25% potentially?

4
0:00:15.200000-->0:00:18.240000
 That way you get to still run five coins?

5
0:00:18.240000-->0:00:20.160000
 Awesome, thank you.
