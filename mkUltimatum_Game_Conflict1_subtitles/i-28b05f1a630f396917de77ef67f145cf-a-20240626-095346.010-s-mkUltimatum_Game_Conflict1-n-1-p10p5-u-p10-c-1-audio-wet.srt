 Interesting, 20 coins. I feel that we should be going sort of in between, like in the middle.

0:00:10.650000-->0:00:17.610000
 I feel like it would be better to sort of split it in. No? Okay then. I'm happy to take a shorter cut then.

0:00:17.650000-->0:00:25.290000
 I might better take a 25% cut. 3 coins?
