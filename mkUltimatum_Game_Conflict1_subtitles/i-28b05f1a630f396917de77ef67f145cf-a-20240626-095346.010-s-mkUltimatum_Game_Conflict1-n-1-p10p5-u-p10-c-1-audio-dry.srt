 Interesting, 20 coins. I feel that we should be going sort of in between, like in the middle.

1
0:00:10.700000-->0:00:14.240000
 I feel like it would be better to sort of split it in...

2
0:00:14.240000-->0:00:17.680000
 No? Okay then. I'm happy to take a shorter cut then.

3
0:00:18.200000-->0:00:19.680000
 I might better take a 25% cut.

4
0:00:24.780000-->0:00:25.360000
 3 coins?
