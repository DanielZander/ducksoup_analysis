 Hello, what's your offer then, what are you thinking?

1
0:00:08.580000-->0:00:09.960000
 Three coins, ooh.

2
0:00:10.300000-->0:00:15.020000
 Would you be possibly interested in bumping it up to five coins to make it 25% potentially?

3
0:00:15.100000-->0:00:18.200000
 That way you get to still run five coins?

4
0:00:18.340000-->0:00:20.120000
 Awesome, thank you.
