0:00:01.100000-->0:00:08.770000
 Go ahead. Make an offer.

1
0:00:09.980000-->0:00:12.880000
 Now I'll reject anything less than 10.

2
0:00:13.860000-->0:00:14.620000
 10 is fair.

3
0:00:14.800000-->0:00:17.860000
 How do you feel if I said I'll reject anything less than 15,

4
0:00:17.860000-->0:00:20.540000
 which is basically what you just did by offering 5.

5
0:00:21.050000-->0:00:23.930000
 So at least 10. 10 is fair, OK?
