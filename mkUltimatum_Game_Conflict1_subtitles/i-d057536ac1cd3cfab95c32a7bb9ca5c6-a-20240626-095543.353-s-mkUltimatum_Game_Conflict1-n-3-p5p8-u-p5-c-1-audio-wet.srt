 Hi, um, yeah, so I'd be willing to offer 3 coins.

1
0:00:11.290000-->0:00:12.670000
 Do you remember taking less than 17?

2
0:00:12.670000-->0:00:14.920000
 I'd just take 2 pounds.

3
0:00:17.600000-->0:00:19.300000
 Well, I'd take...

4
0:00:19.900000-->0:00:21.100000
 Ah, 10 isn't...

5
0:00:22.750000-->0:00:24.470000
 You'd reject anything less than 10?

6
0:00:24.910000-->0:00:25.730000
 That just seems unfair.
