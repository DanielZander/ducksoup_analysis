 Hi, um, yeah, so I'd be willing to offer 3 coins.

1
0:00:11.280000-->0:00:12.740000
 You're only taking less than 17.

2
0:00:13.820000-->0:00:14.880000
 That's a bit too fair.

3
0:00:17.300000-->0:00:19.300000
 Well, I'd say...

4
0:00:19.920000-->0:00:20.860000
 Ah, 10 is...

5
0:00:22.870000-->0:00:24.450000
 You reject anything less than 10.

6
0:00:24.970000-->0:00:25.690000
 That just seems unfair.
